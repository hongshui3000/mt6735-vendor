This module is a legacy feature which supports 
1. updating recovery image secure boot info into SECCFG partition.
2. verify secure file list & secure files.

WHAT IT DOES?
=============
sbchk is a service declared in init.rc and intialized by init process.
Its two functions would be
1. verify secure file list and secure files.
   secure file list will be put at system/etc/firmware/S_ANDRO_SFL.ini. This file
   will be verified first. After that, the content of secure file list will be trusted.
   The files recorded in secure file list will be verified.
   note: In L, sbchk cannot be put into bootimage ramdisk due to SELinux neverallow rules.
   It's put in system/bin folder and is not verified first, thus the reduced security level.
2. update secure boot info into SECCFG
   recovery image will be written to recovery partition after successful boot, SECCFG partition
   will be updated for secure boot.

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================
Most of the files are in binary release format.
Some are in platform independent folder and some are in platform dependent folder.
Platform independent part: vendor/mediatek/proprietary/external/seclib.
Platform dependent part: vendor/mediatek/proprietary/platform/mtxxxx/seclib.
